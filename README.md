# Introduction

Streak on Rails (SoR) was created by a developer with a love of big data and sports. The application emulates a professional application called Streak for the Cash by ESPN. SFTC is a fantasy sports game where contestants try to consecutively select the winners of sports propositions (props) and build the longest streak of the month. The highest streak at the end of the month wins $25,000.

SoR is not a sportsbetting application, but merely a portal for fun, proposition-based picking (sports or otherwise). The application is intended to be a playground for web development and was created and adapted to fulfill the portfolio requirements of Flatiron School's Fullstack Web Development program. 

After forking or cloning the repo, run ```bundle install```.
